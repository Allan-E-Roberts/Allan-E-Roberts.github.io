                I'm Allan, a curious seeker of anything and everything. My goal is to help others to achieve more, and be happier whilst doing so. As an Eagle Scout, my goal is to help others wherever I find an oportunity, and to teach others the skills to be self-sufficient. As an engineer, my goal is to make jobs easier by reducing repetitive and tedious tasks. As a philosopher, my goal is to understand what it means to be happy, satisfied, and moral.

                Life is a journey. Take a moment to enjoy the scenery and smell the roses. I experienced this directly when hiking in Boy Scouts. If you race to the summet, you will reach it faster, but when you give yourself the time to step off the path every once in a while and explore with friends, you will find the journey as rewarding as the goal. When I worked as a cashier at Dollar Tree, I found the simple act of telling bad puns turned a dull job into one that let me engage with customers. I would imagine that you usually don’t pay much attention to the men and women behind the counters, but I ended up acquiring a fan club who would recognize and say hello to me even even when I was walking around VCU, almost half an hour away. When I was teaching at Engineering for Kids, I put extra effort into making the class fun in addition to the lessons with engaging challenges. Ironically, one of my best classes was one where the system was down. I took to the whiteboard and started asking questions about silly robots, and worked my way up to the point that the kindergarteners were solving basic order of operation programming conditions similar to those faced by automated warehouses. If you expect perfection, you will ever be disappointed. If you find the means to make the most of the moment, you will ever find that life always has something to appreciate.

                This website is brand new, and although I have content to add to it, rewriting, reformatting, and making changes to improve the content takes time. Since I only started learning web development less than a month ago, I still end up learning new things about HTML and CSS on occasion. That being said, I plan to add significantly more content, filling out each of the sections above, and breaking those sections into sections as I add more content (such as the ‘outdoors’ section, which will need the informaiton I applied to fix the ESEE-6 knife that I use, how I set up a tarp-poncho without getting wet, and much more). Since I have reached the end of the month, however, I will be prioritizing work much more heavily.
