            <h1>Preparedness:</h1>

            <p>I’m going to make many people very angry. The most important thing that almost every one of you can do to increase your preparedness, is to get outside and get some exercize. That includes you, preppers. Get out there, get fit, and practice. A tool you cannot use is useless, and the one thing that can boost your odds of survival in almost any scenario is the ability to pick something up and run with it. Point made? Good.</p>

            <p>I am splitting the gear up into levels of kit starting with 0, and going up to ___. Each level will build upon the previous kits. Higher numbers will have more gear and be able to do more, but lower numbers will be easier to cary, let you move faster, and will be less noticable.</p>

            <p>Level 0: Pocket equipment</p>

            <p>This is general EDC (Every Day Cary) that doesn't require a bag. Your cell phone, wallet, and keys are all EDC items. Although many multi-tools are advertized, I advise purchasing a small number of good tools that you really think you will use (as oposed to an 'EDC' pen, 'EDC' wallet card, and 'EDC' key, each of which has only one functional tool: A bottle opener). That's not to say there aren't good multitools out there. I picked up an unfolding key at Lowes years ago, and I still use it when I need a screwdriver or a small knife from time to time. Just know that most of the time, you get what you pay for. That tool is great, but it's not going to help much if I need to make a fire.</p>
            <!--<div class="RowContainer">
                <div class="MoveLeft">

                    <p>Water Bottle</p>
                    <p>Lighter</p>
                    <p>Multitool</p>
                    <p>Notebook</p>
                </div>

                </div>
            </div>-->

            <p>You might already have all of these items. If so, pat yourself on the back. If not, start here. In either case, you should cary this with you every day. A water bottle can help you stay hydrated, which is good for your mind and body. Ideally, you want at least one liter. If power goes out, or you just have to do some work outside, that water bottle will help you perform at your peak for several hours. Although I don’t have one, a filtered water bottle can be a great option since it allows you to procure water from almost anywhere so you can fill up on the go. A lighter has little direct daily use (unless you smoke, in which case quitting is probably what you should focus on), but a small Bic (or this Explorer electric lighter) can easily fit in your pocket without bothering you. A multitool can help you open bottles, tighten screws, or prepare kindling and aid in making a shelter. I advise getting a good multitool since some are prone to breakage when you really need them. Lastly, a notebook can help you keep track of things you want to remember in everyday life, or allow you to write down events in the case of a disaster. You can write notes for yourself, others, or emergency responders. A notepad can also help you track your path when navigating.</p>

            <p>Level 1: Knife kit</p>

            <p>This is where your kit will start taking on a form based on what you happen to choose, what pack you have, and how you assemble it. Your goal is something light enough to pick up while running without breaking pace, and small enough to fit in an average backpack without getting in the way of what you normally carry. Ideally, this kit should be in a micro backpack, include a folding backpack, or be able to strap onto your belt. This is a bugout bag designed for speed and utility until you can get better equipment. It must be capable of keeping you going for a full week minimum. This means you need to be able to set up shelters, procure clean water, start fire and signal for help, tend to minor injuries, and move fast. Food is not a priority since it’s heavy, bulky, and for this duration, not critical. That being said, if you carry snacks around with you already, absolutely consider them IFF (if and only if) you can do so without degrading your speed of travel.</p>

                <li>Micro RedDevil lure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Knife:</p>
            <p>I use the ESEE-6, but if you don’t know what you want in a knife, or don’t have a full day to spend fixing Randal’s Folly, do not get this. Get a Mora, practice with it, and you will learn wether or not you need anything else. You probably won’t. [[See this link for everything I did to make the ESEE-6 a functional knife.]] Any knife you get must be capable of doing at least the following: Battoning wood, Starting Fires, Whittling. You can sometimes get away with not starting fires with your knife if you have a fantastic fire kit, but a knife and ferro rod combo is one of the most effective ways to start many fires reliably, and there’s a reason so many campers keep that combo on hand as a backup.</p>

            <p>Paracord:</p>
            <p>Paracord is great for setting up shelters, and the multistrand versions come with fishing line built in as well as act as fire starters. It’s helpful if you need to raise or lower something out of reach, and if you know what you’re doing, you can make endless force multipliers with rope.</p>

            <p>Sawyer squeeze and a gravity bag:</p>
            <p>First, if you get the squeeze, throw out the dirty bag and replace it. Seriously, the garbage that Sawyer provides is entirely unable to perform the tasks you need it for. I perfer the Sawyer filter, however, due to its size and function. I can fill the bag with dirty water, hook up the Sawyer, and throw it over my back, sucking the water through without stopping to let gravity do the work for me. I can also fill up the back and set up the gravity system before bed, and have fresh water in the morning. Even better, the Sawyer squeeze comes with everything you need to connect regular plastic bottles up. If you happen to be in a location with several plastic bottles and a river, you could fill all of them with very little effort. Lastly, the Sawyer is backflush capable, so you really won’t need to replace it as long as it’s maintained well. It literally comes with a lifetime warranty. I am considering the Sawyer Micro Squeeze to save even more space. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. It’s crazy.</p>

            <p>Rain poncho and tarp:</p>
            <p>You should have both of these, either individually or combined. Tents are fantastic, but for a kit of this size, I strongly believe the size of a tarp makes it the best choice. I have a combined poncho tarp for space and weight, but it does have one massive downside: It’s nearly impossible to set the tarp up without getting wet since you are now out in the elements without a poncho. This can be worked around, but it does partially defeats the purpose. [[Click here to see how I set it up without getting wet]] </p>

            <p>Stakes:</p>
            <p>Get’yer pitchforks. Git’yer pichforke here. I said it. Get a tarp for the weight, but also pack tent stakes. Look, if you want to spend the time wittling your stakes when you find a spot, if you happen to find good wood, then go for it. I can make my own stakes as well, and have tried camping withthout dedicated ones. In my experience, you can go farther with a few light stakes than you can without. The time and effort it takes to whittle a Good set of stakes is far greater than what you will spend walking with a prepared set that’s already designed for efficiency and prewrapped with the cordage you intend to use. Notice, I said GOOD stakes. Random twigs have a tendancy to fail, and don’t hold cordage well. In an ideal world with good wood and no wind, I will conceed that simple wooden stakes would edge out aluminum and even titanium, but once the wind picks up, you will need either dedicated tools or time, energy, and light to make a replacement. Consider what would happen if a stake broke during a stormy night. Could you make a new one? Sure, if you had a light, but that adds more weight. What about picking up good sticks en rout? Fine, but that means you will end up carrying more weight than you would have with specialy tools.</p>

            <p>Ferro rod wrapped in cordage:</p>
            <p>Do not consider the lighter already mentioned to be a replacement. “Two is one and one is none”. Your everyday cary may happen to be low on fuel or power, or you may break it. Fire is one of the most immportant things you can have, so make sure you have a backup. If you cannot use a ferro rod, then swap it out for something else. Over this distance, a regular lighter is lighter in weight and more dependable. I do suggest wrapping ferro rods in cordage, and lighters in tape to increase grip.</p>

            <p>Micro Fire Kit:</p>
            <p>Get a metal container for a fire kit. Doing so will allow you to create char cloth anywhere you are, as well as protect the kit from the surroundings, and the surroundings from the kit. Mine consists of a Bic lighter, because it’s one of the most dependable sources of fire available, a fresnel lense, for solar fires if I happen to get just the right conditions, 7 hurricane matches with included striker glued into the inside of the tin, an extendable fire blower, char cloth, and some jute cord. I have started fires with every item in this kit, and have modified items to fit because I find them helpful for myself. If you are skilled in making bowdrill fires, add a length of cord so you don’t have to ruin your shoes. I love my fire blowers, so I cut one down so it fits. I know many people who swear by vasoline and cotton, and you can put that in a small plastic bag in this kit instead if you prefer that. Again, my goal is not to tell you what to use, but to give a recommendation on what to prioritize and how to transport it.</p>

            <p>Micro First Aid Kit:</p>
            <p>Cleaning wipes are underrated and vital. If you don’t have the kit to clean a wound, it may become infected. Get some cleaning wipes. Bandages (assorted sizes) are always good to have, as is bandage cloth. I do carry asprin and an alternative. Lastly, I added some fishing line, a bag of small hooks and weights, as well as my favorite knockoff Micro RedDevil lure. Although I don’t plan to fish much with this kit, I added it because I had the space. This pack does not have the space available for a turnicut, but you can make one with cloth and sticks. The intent of this kit is mostly to get you somewhere safer. This is not a general purpose medical kit. A dedicated medical kit should be kept in locations where you may need it (car, workshop, home). Some things may need to be left out, or packing conditions changed if you need additional medical equipment. I wear hard contact lenses, and I know that this kit has nothing for me to clean or store my lenses in. Instead, I have a separate case for that which I will try to make my way to, or I will need to find a case and filter water to use later on. This is not a comfort kit, but a survival one. </p>
